## How to Get Started

If you want to try it out or tweak it, check the **Initialize Guide** in the `doc` folder:

[INITIALIZATION.md](doc/INITIALIZATION.md)

It walks you through everything: prerequisites, installation, running it locally, and even building your own `.exe`.

## What It Does

- Lets you set focus and break timers to keep you on track  
- Shows encouraging quotes to keep you motivated  
- Built with Electron and Electron Forge, so it runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux  
- Frontend lives in `render/`, main process in `src/main.js`  
- Optional docs are in `doc/` if you want to dig deeper
